        <h1>Setting Up Docker NGINX</h1>
        <p>So first off, this is really simple...now...  And that is the beauty of using docker images, they can speed up just about anything!
            Docker has some really great walk-throughs and tutorials and if you are looking for resources to learn more about Docker
            here are some great ones.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/"></a>Docker Docs</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/index.htm">Tutorials Point</a></li>
            </ul>

            Getting started, I'm going to assume you have Docker installed, if not check out the instructions here:  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Getting Started with Docker</a>
            Once Docker is installed just follow the steps below.

            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <h3>Getting the NGINX Docker Image</h3>
            You need a copy of the NGINX Docker image on your local environment.  You can achieve this by inputting the following command.  This will pull
            the latest/newest NGINX image in the Docker Repo.
            <p><em>docker pull nginx</em></p>
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <h3>Run the Docker Image</h3>
            Now that you have image you can simply run the image, passing in the working directory where your website is located to the NGINX website
            directory.  This allows you to simply navigate to http://localhost and boom see changes live as you make them.  Navigate to the directory in your
            terminal where you website id located, and run this command.
            <p>MacOS and Probably Linux</p>
            <p><em>docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html -p 80:80 nginx</em></p>
            <p>Windows 10</p>
            <p><em>docker run --rm -v %cd%:/usr/share/nginx/html -p 80:80 nginx</em></p>
            <h4>What is this command doing? </h4>
            docker run - tells docker to run an image <br>
            --rm <br>
            -v is doing the magic of mapping the current directory you are in (your website directory) to the websites directory of the docker image <br>
            -p is mapping port 80 on the NGINX container to your host, allowing you to browse to http://localhost:80 to see your site. <br>
            nginx is the image you want to run (this is the image you pulled down in step 1) <br>
