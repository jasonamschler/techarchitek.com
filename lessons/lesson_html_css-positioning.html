    <h1>Position Properties</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Static - Go along with default rules</h2>
    <div id="staticapple"><img src="/images/apple.png"></div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Relative - Relative to where it would have been</h2>
    <p>The apple below is moved to the right 100 pixels, relative to where it would have been</p>
    <div id="relativeapple"><img src="/images/apple.png"></div>
    <p>There are two apples below.  The bottom one is static the top one is relative and moved down 30 pixels.</p>
    <div id="relativedownapple"><img src="/images/apple.png"></div>
    <div id="staticapple"><img src="/images/apple.png"></div>
    <h3>Relative with Inline Block</h3>
    <p>The sqaures below are 100 pixel X 100 pixel divs with inline block so they are on the same line and relative position to order them.  
        There original order is <span id="redhighlight">red</span>, <span id="yellowhighlight">yellow</span> and <span id="bluehighlight">blue</span>.  The CSS reorders them.
    </p>
    <div id="redsquare"></div>
    <div id="yellowsquare"></div>
    <div id="bluesquare"></div>
    <h3>Relative with Absolute</h3>
    <p>So the green square below is moved to the right, but with left=50px because it is set to relative positioning.  This is relative to where it would have been.</p>
    <p>The pink square inside the green square is also moved to the right, but with right=25px, because it's position is set to
        absolute, to the Green Square DIV tag that is inside of.
    </p>
    <div id="greensquare">
        <div id="pinksquare"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Absolute</h2>
    <p>The colored squares below are set to their postion by absolute positioning, relative to the light gray square they reside within.</p>

        <div id=greenyellowsquare></div>
        <div id=magentasquare></div>
