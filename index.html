        <h2>Two Purposes</h2>
        <h3>1 - Who is Jason Amschler.</h3>
        <p>
            There are two of us on the web if you google my name.  I am the software engineer, the past Global IT Manager, Business Analyst, Developer, System Adminstrator... 
            I have had the extrordinary opportunity to wear many hats and work across several different sectors of the technology
            industry.  To learn more about me and my resume click the links below.
        </p>
        <p><form action="resume.html">
            <button class="custom-btn btn-5">Resume</button>
        </form>
            </p>
        <h3>2 - Help Others.</h3>
        <p>
            I've always wanted to create a place for people to come and just get started.  The goal of this site is 
            to create a step by step walkthrough as I work to improve my skillset.  My intention is to document this journey and share it with others.
            This homepage will change over time as my skillset grows, but for now check out "<a href="/beginning.html">The Beginning</a>" a nice basic HTML
            page to see what I am up to, and for everyone to know its okay to start basic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The one thing I want to emphasize for anyone who is a seasoned technology professional, is its okay to step back every once and 
            a while.  I have almost 15 years total experience in some form of technology.  Hats that have fell on my head include:  System Administrator,
            Business Analyst, Process Engineer, Developer, Software Engineer, Global IT Manager.  <em>But this journey is about strengthening and deepening my
            skillset, scaling up so to speak versus scaling out.</em>  I hope this journey lasts many more years, and I hope this place on the spider
            web of information becomes a stop over for those considering the same.
        </p>
        <h3>Drupal</h3>
        <p>
            I have done a lot of things in my career, but Drupal hasn't been one of them...  Do you know what that means?  It means
            I am going to work on learning Drupal and adding that to my skillset tree, I am doing that at the same time I work through
            sharpening my web dev teeth.  You can follow my progress if you would like!
