    <h3>Basic Web Development</h3>
    <p>
        I am looking to create a step by step walkthrough of my life as I work to improve my skillset.
        My intention is to document this journey and share it with others.  This homepage will
        change over time as my skillset grows, but for now check out the links to see what I am up to.  My promise is "The Beginning"
        will never change, its a way to endorse anyone just getting started, that its okay to start simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one thing I want to emphasize for anyone who is a seasoned technology professional, is its okay to step back every once and 
        a while.  I have almost 15 years total experience in some form of technology.  Hats that have fell on my head include:  System Administrator,
        Business Analyst, Process Engineer, Developer, Software Engineer, Global IT Manager.  <em>But this journey is about strengthening and deepening my
        skillset, scaling up so to speak versus scaling out.</em>  I hope this journey lasts many more years, and I hope this place on the spider
        web of information becomes a stop over for those considering the same.
    </p>
    <h3>Drupal</h3>
    <p>
        I have done a lot of things in my career, but Drupal hasn't been one of them...  Do you know what that means?  It means
        I am going to work on learning Drupal and adding that to my skillset tree, I am doing that at the same time I work through
        sharpening my web dev teeth.  You can follow my progress if you would like!
