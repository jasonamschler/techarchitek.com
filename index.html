    <p>I am looking to create a step by step walkthrough of my life as I work to improve my skillset.
        My intention is to document this journey and share it with others.  This homepage will
        change over time as my skillset grows, but for now check out the links to see what I am up to.  My promise is "The Beginning"
        will never change, its a way to endorse anyone just getting started, that its okay to start simple.
