    <h3>CSS is kind of a big deal</h3>
    <p>So after my August hiatus, I am still in CSS, and probably will be for a while.  There is a lot to wrap your head around in understanding
        how it works.  I don't feel too bad when I hear seasoned developers at work, say "CSS is not my thing".. So I know there is a lot here to 
        learn.  If your checking the site and the CSS lesson pages, your probably seeing ugly pages from day to day..week to week, as I experiment
        with breaking CSS and figuring out how it all inter-relates.  Right now I'm into boxes.  I just made a bunch of DIV boxes on my lesson page
        and I am experimenting with moving them around.  <a href="./lessons/lesson_html_div-page.html">DIV Page</a>

    <h3>Nothing Much.. trying to endure Covid...</h3>
    <p>I've been pretty busy this month, for one thing trying to figure out how to home school two teenagers and two elementary students.  Work has 
        also been crazy with some personnel changes... all added up hasn't left me much time to keep up with my lessons.  BUT... And this is a piece
        of advice for anyone trying to learn something.  "You don't have to learn it all at once"... Breaks are okay.. IF you get back to it.  Getting
        back to it is a lot easier if you reserve a specific time to do it.  For me, prior to school starting, it was in the morning, while all the kids
        slept in.  Now... its late at night after they are in bed, but before I'm ready to crash.  I reward myself with some video games for a bit, then
        on to my lesson.  The lesson actually helps to calm my mind... especially after a battle in Breath of the Wild..

    <h3>CSS CSS CSS</h3>
    <p>I have been spending a lot of time with CSS.  There is a lot to learn and there is no way you are going to just...learn it.  It is going to
        take practice and bein challenged with problems and issues to fully understand how it all plays together.  You can self create some issues
        by looking at other websites in the wild and choosing to try to reproduce elements you see and like.  This is a great resource for getting
        started playing with all the CSS toys:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">MDN Reference Page</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Prettification</h3>
    <p>Okay I've worked through all the base HTML lessons, excited to get into CSS.  I've played around with CSS alot in the past, I am very familar with it,
        but I'm still excited to go back and learn from step 1.  Changes should be coming soon!  Some great web links from this lesson:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://colorhunt.co/">Deciding on a Color Pallette</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">MDN Color Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://coolors.co/">Create Your Own Color Theme - So far my favorite</a></li>
        </ul>
        Okay I can tell you the hardest part of this, is deciding on colors... Yes I know with CSS they can easily be changed at any time.  Colors,
        however, become part of your brand, your identity.  They are kind of a big deal...I wish I had my 64 crayon color box back....  I can see
        that I am going to spend quite a bit of time in CSS land, just playing with the look and feel of the site.

    <h3>Ancient Forms</h3>
    <p>Wow the nostalgia of good old fashioned forms..when you could stick your email address out on the internet, and not get a tera-trillion spam messages!
        Check out my form page <a href="/lessons/lesson_html-forms.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Playing with Tables</h3>
    <p>I decided to make a page of just tables.. to play around with them and learn more about them.  Check it out <a href="/lessons/lesson_html-tables.html">here.</a></p>
    <h3>Setting up a Webserver to Test</h3>
    <p>Okay I've conquered getting a Docker image to work just like I want now.  I settled on using a Docker NGINX image and I just mount my website directory
        directly into the image.  I have the port 80 mapped to my local, so now I can just save and refresh and boom see my updated site.  For a step by step
        walk-through of what I did just click <a href="/lessons/lesson_setting-up-nginx-docker-image.html">Setting Up Docker NGINX</a>

    <h2>June 2020</h2>
    <p>I've started taking a class on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, I had found referenced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>.  I can say so far I am loving the class.
        I am starting from the beginning, even though I am already fairly comfortable with basic HTML.  The class is a full-stack development
        course, taking you from HTML through CSS, JS and Database.  I already know all these from a basic to intermediate level, but I have never
        done anything with them... so this is my journey.
    </p>
    <p>This course has put me onto some great webresources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Course I'm Taking</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">MDN Web Docs</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay the first thing I am going to need to do is setup a nice and easy way to view my website on my local development machine.
        Even starting out, because of my past experience, I know about 10 ways to do this... but I'm going to try to do it using a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image.
        Why?  Because I want some more experience with Docker and it sounds like a great way to get it.
