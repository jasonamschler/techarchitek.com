    <h3>Prettification</h3>
    <p>Okay I've worked through all the base HTML lessons, excite to get into CSS.  I've play around with CSS alot in the past, I am very familar with it,
        but I'm still excited to go back and learn from step 1.  Changes should be coming soon!  Some great web links from this lesson:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://colorhunt.co/">Deciding on a Color Pallette</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">MDN Color Page</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Ancient Forms</h3>
    <p>Wow the nostalgia of good old fashioned forms..when you could stick your email address out on the internet, and not get a tera-trillion spam messages!
        Check out my form page <a href="/lessons/lesson_html-forms.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Playing with Tables</h3>
    <p>I decided to make a page of just tables.. to play around with them and learn more about them.  Check it out <a href="/lessons/lesson_html-tables.html">here.</a></p>
    <h3>Setting up a Webserver to Test</h3>
    <p>Okay I've conquered getting a Docker image to work just like I want now.  I settled on using a Docker NGINX image and I just mount my website directory
        directly into the image.  I have the port 80 mapped to my local, so now I can just save and refresh and boom see my updated site.  For a step by step
        walk-through of what I did just click <a href="/lessons/lesson_setting-up-nginx-docker-image.html">Setting Up Docker NGINX</a>

    <h2>June 2020</h2>
    <p>I've started taking a class on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, I had found referenced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>.  I can say so far I am loving the class.
        I am starting from the beginning, even though I am already fairly comfortable with basic HTML.  The class is a full-stack development
        course, taking you from HTML through CSS, JS and Database.  I already know all these from a basic to intermediate level, but I have never
        done anything with them... so this is my journey.
    </p>
    <p>This course has put me onto some great webresources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Course I'm Taking</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements">MDN Web Docs</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay the first thing I am going to need to do is setup a nice and easy way to view my website on my local development machine.
        Even starting out, because of my past experience, I know about 10 ways to do this... but I'm going to try to do it using a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image.
        Why?  Because I want some more experience with Docker and it sounds like a great way to get it.
