    <h1>Jason Amschler - TechArchitek</h1>
    <p>This is to document the beginning of TechArchitek.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>June 2020</h2>
    <p>I've started taking a class on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>, I had found referenced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>.  I can say so far I am loving the class.
        I am starting from the beginning, even though I am already fairly comfortable with basic HTML.  The class is a full-stack development
        course, taking you from HTML through CSS, JS and Database.  I already know all these from a basic to intermediate level, but I have never
        done anything with them... so this is my journey.
    </p>
    <p>This course has put me onto some great webresources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/"></a>The Course I'm Taking</li>
        <li><a href="https://codepen.io/"></a>CodePen</li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements"></a>MDN Web Docs</li>
        <li><a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay the first thing I am going to need to do is setup a nice and easy way to view my website on my local development machine.
        Even starting out, because of my past experience, I know about 10 ways to do this... but I'm going to try to do it using a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image.
        Why?  Because I want some more experience with Docker and it sounds like a great way to get it.
